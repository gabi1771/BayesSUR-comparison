In this repository, you can find the code I used to compare the different methods of the BayesSUR package developped by Mr. Zhi Zhao in the paper : 10.18637/jss.v100.i11 . 
To compare those methods I used a simulation which could represent several situations in finance, marketing or biology. 
This work was done during my research internship at University of Oslo in the biostatistics department under the supervision of Mr. Zhi Zhao (May - August 2024).
